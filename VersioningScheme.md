# Versioning Scheme #

It's really simple, because my project is tiny and there are no things like "stable branch", etc.

The first number means major version, current one is 2 and I guess it will be the last.  Both versions are like two different products (bmpanel1 and bmpanel2) but they share the common idea. Themes from version 1.0 will never work with 2.0 and vice versa.

The second number since version 2.0 means the release (it's like a signal for package maintainers, that some point in development process was achieved and they should make a package for it). The next versions will be (in chronological order):
2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, ..., 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, ..., 2.XXXX.

And there is always a version that is referred as git version. It is the current development version and everyone who either wants to be on the bleeding edge of this software or who wants to contribute somehow or be involved in the development process in any way should use that version.
