## bmpanel2 project ##

Nice NETWM-compatible panel for X11. Features:
  * Look'n'feel customization via themes (see ThemeGallery).
  * A bunch of widgets: desktop switcher, taskbar, launchbar, systray, clock, decor, empty.
  * Pseudo-transparency support.
  * Written in C with speed and clarity in mind.
  * Small number of dependencies, briefly: glib2, cairo, pango, libX11.
  * Small memory footprint (about 2-4 megabytes).
  * Small executable (80 kilobytes at the moment).
